# Portfolio-Optimization-Performance-Analysis

**The below project is for Educational purposes only**

Overview: This project focuses on portfolio optimization by analyzing the performance of randomly selected technology and financial stocks in a portfolio over a 30-year period. Historical data (2000-2024) and projected data (2025-2030) have been used to calculate cumulative returns, volatility, and risk metrics. The Monte Carlo Simulation was used for forecasting future portfolio performance by simulating possible market conditions and evaluating risk and return over a given period of time. This project also applies techniques such as maximization of the Sharpe ratio to create an optimal portfolio. To effectively visualize the data, the project includes a histogram of the Monte Carlo Simulation, Actual VS Project Returns of the Portfolio, and projected cumulative returns of all stocks in the portfolio. This analysis also identifies the best and worst performing stock.
